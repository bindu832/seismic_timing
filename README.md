# Seismic Timing Project - DATA 583

**Group members:** Harpreet Singh, Himabindu Joopally, Wei Tang

**Dataset:**  Seismic timings (z) measured by geophones dropped into ditches dug along transects following the (x,y) coordinates. (Central Alberta)

**Models Considered:**

- Bivariate spline regression with equally spaced knots (b-spline)
- Generalized additive models with guassian family
- Generalized additive models with gamma family
- Generalized additive models with thin-plate splines
- Generalized additive models with tensor-product splines
 
**Metrics:**
Adjusted R, Deviance, AIC
 
**Selected Model:**
Generalized additive models with thin-plate splines
