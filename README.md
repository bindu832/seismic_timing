# Seismic Timing Project - DATA 583

Group members: Harpreet Singh, Himabindu Joopally, Wei Tang

Dataset:  seismic timings (z) measured by geophones dropped into ditches dug along transects following the (x,y) coordinates.

Models: 
- multiple linear regression, 
- bivariate spline regression with equally spaced knots (b-spline), 
- thin-plate splines, 
- generalized additive models with normal families,
- generalized additive models with gamma families.
